# Cutaneous Leishmaniosis Cases in Saudi Arabia: SQL Analysis

This project involves analyzing a dataset covering 16 regions in Saudi Arabia, focusing on cutaneous leishmaniasis cases from 2018 to 2022. The dataset includes patient numbers, demographics (Saudis vs. non-Saudis, residents vs. non-residents, males vs. females), and age distribution from less than 1 year to over 45 years.


## Queries Overview

### Descriptive Statistics Query
- Computes descriptive statistics such as counts, totals, averages, minimums, maximums, and standard deviations for regions.
- Utilizes SQL aggregation functions and subqueries.

### Yearly Average and Standard Deviation Query
- Calculates the average and standard deviation for each year independently.
- Efficiently uses aggregation functions for different subsets of data.

### Top 5 Regions Query
- Retrieves the top 5 regions based on total patients.
- Utilizes `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses for result set manipulation.

### Percentage Change in Patients Query
- Calculates the percentage change in patients' numbers between 2018 and 2022 for each region.
- Utilizes conditional logic (`CASE` statement) for categorizing changes.

### Total Patients for Each Age Group Query
- Aggregates data for each age group and calculates total patients.
- Demonstrates proficiency in grouping data and calculating totals.

### Regions with Increase in Patients Query
- Filters regions where the number of patients increased from 2018 to 2022.
- Utilizes `WHERE` clause for conditional filtering.

### Demographics Information Query
- Aggregates demographic information such as total males, total females, Saudis, non-Saudis, residents, and non-residents.
