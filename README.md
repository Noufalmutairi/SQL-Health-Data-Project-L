# Cutaneous Leishmaniosis Cases in Saudi Arabia: SQL Analysis

This project involves analyzing a dataset covering 16 regions in Saudi Arabia, focusing on cutaneous leishmaniasis cases from 2018 to 2022. The dataset includes patient numbers, demographics (Saudis vs. non-Saudis, residents vs. non-residents, males vs. females), and age distribution from less than 1 year to over 45 years.

## Key Insights to Explore

1. **Distribution of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis**
   - Analyze the overall distribution of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases across the regions.

2. **Regions with the Highest Increase in Patient Numbers**
   - Identify the five regions with the highest increase in the number of patients over the specified period.

3. **Regions with Increasing Trends from 2018 to 2022**
   - Determine which regions are experiencing an increase in cutaneous leishmaniasis cases from 2018 to 2022.

4. **Demographics Distribution**
   - Explore the distribution of patients based on demographics, including nationality (Saudis vs. non-Saudis) and residency status (residents vs. non-residents).

5. **Age Distribution**
   - Analyze the age distribution of patients to understand the prevalence of cutaneous leishmaniasis across different age groups.

## Recommendations

1. **Strengthen Surveillance and Reporting**
   - Implement an enhanced surveillance system to ensure timely and accurate reporting of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases. This will facilitate early detection and effective response to outbreaks.

2. **Targeted Interventions**
   - Allocate additional resources and implement targeted interventions, such as vector control measures and public awareness campaigns, in regions witnessing a high increase in cases. Focus on regions like Al Ahsa, Hail, Aseer, Qassem, and Medinah.

3. **Vulnerable Population Focus**
   - Develop strategies to address the needs of vulnerable populations, including children aged 10 to 15 and individuals aged 45 and above, who are more susceptible to cutaneous leishmaniasis.

4. **Collaborative Efforts**
   - Promote collaboration among health organizations, research institutions, and stakeholders to encourage data sharing, research initiatives, and joint efforts in combating cutaneous leishmaniasis.
